# Daily update

Day 4 - Finished assignment 1.

Day 3 - Learned CSS and HTML tables. Couldn't finish as planned due to power outage.

Day 2 - Learned more about forms and CSS. Started to work on Assignment 1 and updating it as I learn more.

Day 1 - Learned about different HTML elements and tags. Took an overview of CSS and JS.

Day 0 - Learned about Client - (Proxy) - Server model. Read about HTTP messages, headers, status codes etc. 
Didn't memorise all the status codes. Already knew a few common ones like 200, 404, 403, 500 etc.
Got an idea how proxies work and how to manipulate cache behavior using Cache-Control.
Didn't understand the full scope of cookies and how they work. Got the basic idea. I think the use of cookies is somewhat implementation dependant.
So, I have to see some actual server side codes to understand cookies properly.
